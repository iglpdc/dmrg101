Welcome to DMRG101 tutorial's pages!
====================================

These pages contain a few exercises to be used with the dmrg101 code. The
exercises are the ones used for the hands-on tutorial of the `Taipei
Density Matrix Renormalization Group Winter School
<http://sites.google.com/site/dmrg101/home>`_. We hope that even those
that could not attend to the School can find this useful to learn some
basics about the `Density Matrix
Renormalization Group algorithm
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group>`_
(DMRG).

Some of the exercises here are adapted from a similar tutorial by Adrian
Feiguin, which is published in ...

This page is only about the tutorial itself. If you need information about
the drmg101 code, check out the dmrg101 documentation.
