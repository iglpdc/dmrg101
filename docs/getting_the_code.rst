Getting the code
----------------

If you are attending the School, you don't need to do this. You still have
full access to the source code using the :ref:`quick-installation` method.
The developer method is only for those wanting to contribute to the
development of dmrg101 or want it to fork the repository.

If you want to have access to the repository, you can clone it in your
machine: ::

    $ git clone https://github.com/iglpdc/dmrg101.git
        
This will download the latest version of dmrg101 repository.

Alternatively, you can just go to the `GitHub repository of the code
<https://github.com/iglpdc/dmrg101>`_, and grab it, fork it, or whatever.
